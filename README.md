## Description

> In this lesson you will learn what is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and how it interacts with with the HTML elements of your website and Javascript. Learn how to use CSS to style those HTML elements and the 'cascading effect'.

## Objectives

After completing this lesson, participants will be able to:

* Define what is CSS and the role it plays on a website (here is where I'm thinking the fundamental the role of HTML, CSS and Javascript can come in at a high level)
* Define the anatomy of a CSS block and illustrate how it can be applied to HTML
* Illustrate how to use basic CSS to modify the HTML elements of your site (text, backgrounds)
* Define what is a CSS class and id and show how it can be applied to the HTML elements of your site
* Explain the 'cascading' effect and how you can arrange your CSS to reflect this

> It’s required that you include a bulleted list of objective(s) for each lesson plan. Objectives should be worded as actions that the participant can do once they’ve finished. See [Bloom's Taxonomy of Action Verbs](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/oie/documents/assesments/Blooms%20Level.pdf) (PDF) as a reference. Avoid using words like "know," "understand," "be introduced to," etc. There should be one assement item for each objective (see below).

>
> *  Participants may need to download the TwentySixteen theme before beginning
